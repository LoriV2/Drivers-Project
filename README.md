# Contact Directory Application - Erasmus Project

This project was developed during my Erasmus internship in Portugal. It is a simple web application that displays contact information, built with **PHP** for the backend and **Bootstrap/JavaScript/CSS** for the frontend. The application connects to a **MySQL** database to retrieve and display contact details.

## Key Features:
- **Display Contacts**: The app shows a list of contacts with their associated details.
- **List.js Integration**: Users can easily search and filter contacts using **List.js**.
- **Contact Information**:
  - Category
  - Address
  - Name
  - Button to view the location on a map

## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Search**: List.js

This project showcases my ability to build a functional, searchable directory using common web technologies during a real-world internship experience.
